## Description
  - At the beginning, passengers are created with their destination. Elevator knows where passengers want to go even in the other elevators.
  - Elevators should transport as many people as possible to their destinations as quickly as possible.
  - Reward is a negative value for the sum of people in a building and in elevators.
## Implemented Algorithms
  - PPO + GAE

## RUN

~~~
python main.py
~~~
  - if you want to change hyper-parameters, you can check "python main.py --help"
  - you just train and test basic model using main.py
